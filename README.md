# 7 ½ game

A simple 7 ½ game made with [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

The textures of the cards are from [itch.io](https://mreliptik.itch.io/playing-cards-packs-52-cards).

The project was created using [vite](https://vite.dev/). I used the `bun` package manager, but `npm` can be used too.

```
bun i
bun run dev
```

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

This is my first time using [three.js](https://threejs.org/), and I used it because I wanted to try it out and this project was a great learning experience.

> I do not deliver it to be graded, as I have worked on this project with Natàlia. I just deliver it for you to see what would I do if I were to work on this alone.
